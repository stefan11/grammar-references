  abstract = {Theories of natural language syntax often characterize grammatical knowledge as a form of abstract computation. This paper argues that such a characterization is correct, and that fundamental properties of grammar can and should be understood in terms of restrictions on the complexity of possible grammatical computation, when defined in terms of generative capacity. More specifically, the paper demonstrates that the computational restrictiveness imposed by Tree Adjoining Grammar provides important insights into the nature of human grammatical knowledge.},

  abstract = {The phase-based approach to grammatical derivation and one rooted in the Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) formalism share the idea that the derivation of a complex sentence is divided into separate derivations of local domains. These approaches differ, however, in their treatment of syntactic dependencies spanning across such local domains. Under the phase approach, operations in a higher domain can access the edge of a lower domain in accordance with the Phase Impenetrability Condition. In TAG, one local domain can be inserted within another under the adjoining operation. This difference has important consequences for how the locality properties of syntactic dependencies are explained. In this paper, I systematically compare the explanations for locality effects under phases and TAG. I explore the degree to which the explanations offered by these different approaches generalize across A- and A′-movement, across different structural contexts, and across the phenomena of displacement and agreement, and whether such generalization is empirically warranted in each case.},

@article{Koenig1999b,
  abstract = {This paper discusses the grammar of the French Inalienable Possession Construction (IPC). It is argued that the IPC involves an unexpressed reflexive anaphor. The antecedent of this reflexive anaphor must satisfy a semantic condition which requires consideration of thematic lexical entailments. The model-theoretic nature of this constraint suggests that the range of semantic information relevant to syntactic processes goes beyond the formal configuration of semantic metalanguages. It also shows that the semantic conditions which anaphors can impose on their antecedents are not restricted to thematic ranking or center of perspective restrictions. An analysis of the construction within Head-driven Phrase-Structure Grammar is provided.},

In computational applications of natural language processing, the need for a compact representation arises in order to avoid potentially highly disjunctive specifications of different readings which scope ambiguities may introduce. Typical instances of ambiguities treated by underspecification are scope ambiguities of adjectives in NPs with respect to PPs as illustrated in (la), and different possible scopings of a quantifier with respect to some other scope-bearing element in sentences like (lb) (cf. Pinkal, 1995; Reyle, 1993).},

@article{Levine2012a-u,
  abstract = {In a 1982 paper in the journal Glossa, Pullum outlined a set of arguments for treating English infinitival to as a defective auxiliary verb. Twenty years later, in his entry on infinitival constructions in The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language (CGEL, 2002), Huddleston argues that several distributional facts about auxiliaries fit poorly with this hypothesis. He proposes, on the basis of significant structural parallels, that to is a subordinator (complementizer). I show that Huddleston's arguments constitute a flawed analysis in CGEUs otherwise superb coverage of English descriptive grammar, and that the facts run strongly counter to his claims, often falling out independently from generalizations about auxiliaries that Huddleston overlooks. Several of these points were anticipated in Pullum's paper, but recent research on an idiosyncratic auxiliary-specific pattern of English nonrestrictive relative clause formation provides a powerful new argument in support of the auxiliary claim. In this respect, as in all others, the assignment of to to the class of auxiliaries provides the simplest and broadest account of its syntactic behavior.},

The strongest interpretation of this conclusion is that the cases explicitly considered are typical. UG leaves no choice: Scope must be expressed hierarchically, there are no covert LF phrasal movements permitted by UG, and neither can the effect of covert phrasal movement be achieved by feature raising. Scope reflects the interaction of merger and overt movement.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an analysis of unagreement, a phenomenon involving an apparent mismatch between a definite third person plural subject and first or second person plural subject agreement observed in various null subject languages (e.g. Spanish, Modern Greek and Bulgarian), but notoriously absent in others (e.g. Italian, European Portuguese). A cross-linguistic correlation between unagreement and the structure of adnominal pronoun constructions suggests that the availability of unagreement depends on whether person and definiteness are hosted by separate heads (in languages like Greek) or bundled on a single head (i.e. pronominal determiners in languages like Italian). Null spell-out of the head hosting person features high in the extended nominal projection of the subject leads to unagreement. The lack of unagreement in languages with pronominal determiners results from the interaction of their syntactic structure with the properties of the vocabulary items realising the head encoding both person and definiteness. The analysis provides a principled explanation for the cross-linguistic distribution of unagreement and suggests a unified framework for deriving unagreement, adnominal pronoun constructions, personal pronouns and pro. „wir studenten“ Pronomen + Nomen},

  abstract = {This paper offers a refutation of Chomsky's Universal Grammar (UG) from a novel perspective. It comprises a central part, clarifications and comparisons. The central part starts with an examination of Chomsky's research method and then argues that the method is seriously flawed and that it cannot lead to the discovery of any innate universals of language. In the clarifications part, a number of questions that could be raised concerning the central part of the refutation are presented and answered. The answers to these questions help to make clearer why UG is deeply problematic, and thus consolidate the central part of the refutation. The comparisons part discusses some representative critiques of UG by other scholars, shows their inadequacies, and thus further highlights the value of the present critique.},

The theory proposed removes the phenomenon from the set of universal parameters and argues for the possibility of reducing it to directional government and feature identification. In this way we begin to explain why some languages do and some do not allow empty subjects. Notice that when one attributes a property to a parameter one is saying, in effect, that that property cannot be explained, at least not linguistically. The main purpose of this paper has been to try to explain linguistically the pro-drop parameter.},

@article{PX98a,
  abstract = {While recognizing a fundamental distinction between syntactic use of reflexives and nonsyntactic use of reflexives, we propose that this distinction is not necessarily one of lexical ambiguity, contrary to what has been commonly assumed (e.g., Baker (1995)). Instead, we posit just one type of referentially dependent element –reflexives –which avail themselves of two options for being related to their antecedents, namely, syntactic binding and discourse coreference. We focus on Chinese reflexive ziji but will also consider reflexives in American English and British English. Data from these languages indicate that obligatory binding (as stated in Principle A of Chomsky (1986)) is something of a special case and should not be taken as a general model for a cross-linguistic approach to reflexives. We also show that argument structure is relevant to long-distance binding in Chinese, and thus the syntactic binding domain can be defined in terms of relative OBLIQUENESS of grammatical relations rather than a purely tree-configurational relation, e.g., C-COMMAND.},

Section 1 is devoted to establishing the surface constituent structures of sentences involving the various relative and relative-like clauses. In sections 1 and 2 I provide evidence that pseudo-relative clauses are not restrictive relative clauses (nor are they nonrestrictive clauses) and indicate which apparent relative clauses must be classed as pseudo-relative. Section 3 is concerned with the derivation of nonrestrictive clauses. Sections 4 and 5 deal with two different analyses of restrictive relatives, each of which is supported by a sizeable body of data and appears to be irreconcileable with the data that support the other analysis. In section 6 an attempt is made to achieve a synthesis of the two analyses on the basis of a ‘core’ of grammatical rules proper and a set of ‘patches’ that serve to extend the speaker's competence to cover cases for which the core rules do not yield admissible derivations. The analyses developed make extensive use of the conception of syntactic category that is developed in McCawley 1977a, 1980b.},

  abstract = {Syntax is a central subfield within linguistics and is important for the study of natural languages, since they all have syntax. Theories of syntax can vary drastically, though. They tend to be based on one of two competing principles, on dependency or phrase structure. Surprisingly, the tests for constituents that are widely employed in syntax and linguistics research to demonstrate the manner in which words are grouped together forming higher units of syntactic structure (phrases and clauses) actually support dependency over phrase structure. The tests identify much less sentence structure than phrase structure syntax assumes. The reason this situation is surprising is that phrase structure has been dominant in research on syntax over the past 60 years. This article examines the issue in depth. Dozens of texts were surveyed to determine how tests for constituents are employed and understood. Most of the tests identify phrasal constituents only; they deliver little support for the existence of subphrasal strings as constituents. This situation is consistent with dependency structure, since for dependency, subphrasal strings are not constituents to begin with.},

Aoun, Benmamoun, and Sportiche (1994) have presented an analysis for Arabic in which the conjuncts are clauses rather than Noun Phrases. This article argues that partial agreement is a subclass of a more general, and widespread, phenomenon: unbalanced coordination (Johannessen 1993b). An analysis is presented in which conjuncts can be NPs as well as other categories. The central idea is that the conjunction heads a Conjunction Phrase and that unbalanced coordination is a possible consequence of specifier-head agreement. This explains a correlation between the order of conjuncts that have different grammatical features and the order of head and complement in these languages.},

  abstract = {The paper investigates first and last conjunct agreement in Serbo-Croatian, the latter being a rather rare phenomenon for head initial languages. The paper gives a uniform account of first and last conjunct agreement based on the operation Agree (Chomsky 2000). The account captures both the contexts where first and last conjunct agreement exhibit parallel behavior and the contexts where the parallelism between the two breaks down. The analysis also captures interaction between gender and number agreement. Given the complexity of the first/last conjunct agreement paradigm in Serbo-Croatian, to the extent that it is successful the analysis presented in the paper provides strong evidence in favor of the operation Agree in general, as well as the particular approach to Agree adopted in the paper. The system developed in the paper allows one instance of uninterpretable features, namely valued uninterpretable features, not to undergo feature checking and does not require uninterpretable features in general to undergo feature checking with interpretable features, differing in these respects from Chomsky (2000, 2001a) and Pesetsky and Torrego (2007).},

@article{vanTrijp2016a-u,
  abstract = {Word order, argument structure and unbounded dependencies are among the most important topics in linguistics because they touch upon the core of the syntax-semantics interface. One question is whether “marked” word order patterns, such as The man I talked to vs. I talked to the man, require special treatment by the grammar or not. Mainstream linguistics answers this question affirmatively: in the marked order, some mechanism is necessary for “extracting” the man from its original argument position, and a special placement rule (e.g. topicalization) is needed for putting the constituent in clause-preceding position. This paper takes an opposing view and argues that such formal complexity is only required for analyses that are based on syntactic trees. A tree is a rigid data structure that only allows information to be shared between local nodes, hence it is inadequate for non-local dependencies and can only allow restricted word order variations. A construction, on the other hand, offers a more powerful representation device that allows word order variations – even unbounded dependencies – to be analyzed as the side-effect of how language users combine the same rules in different ways in order to satisfy their communicative needs. This claim is substantiated through a computational implementation of English argument structure constructions in Fluid Construction Grammar that can handle both comprehension and formulation.},

The first shows how certain apparently inexplicable uses of it (as in beat it!) can be related to a pro-nominalization observed in the paradigm. The second shows how nouns like cannonball, steamroller, skyrocket, etc., can become verbs. The third result is a verification, by a systematic investigation of the English lexicon, of the common semantic intuition that these sentences can be paraphrased by others like Max made his way through the crowd by using his elbows.},

  abstract = {Minimalism in grammatical theorizing (Chomsky in The minimalist program. MIT Press, Cambridge, 1995) led to simpler linguistic devices and a better focalization of the core properties of the structure building engine: a lexicon and a free (recursive) phrase formation operation, dubbed Merge, are the basic components that serve in building syntactic structures. Here I suggest that by looking at the elementary restrictions that apply to Merge (i.e., selection and licensing of functional features), we could conclude that a re-orientation of the syntactic derivation (from bottom-up/right-left to top-down/left-right) is necessary to make the theory simpler, especially for long-distance (filler-gap) dependencies, and is also empirically more adequate. If the structure building operations would assemble lexical items in the order they are pronounced (Phillips in Order and structure. PhD thesis, MIT, 1996; Chesi in Phases and cartography in linguistic computation: Toward a cognitively motivated computational model of linguistic competence. PhD thesis, Università di Siena, 2004; Chesi in Competence and computation: Toward a processing friendly minimalist grammar. Unipress, Padova, 2012), on-line performance data could better fit the grammatical model, without resorting to external ``performance factors.'' The phase-based, top-down (and, as a consequence, left-right) Minimalist Grammar here discussed goes in this direction, ultimately showing how strong Islands (Huang in Logical relations in Chinese and the theory of grammar. PhD thesis, MIT, 1982) and intervention effects (Gordon et al. in J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn 27:1411--1423, 2001, Gordon et al. in J Mem Lang 51:97--114, 2004) could be better explained in structural terms assuming this unconventional derivational direction.},

Such maps interact with principles of syntactic computations, and provide crucial information for the interfaces with sound and meaning. In this chapter, I will concentrate on the role that cartographic representations have in the expression of interpretive properties and, in particular, in the organization of informational structures for the proper articulation of discourse and dialogues, and in the assignment of scope to operators. I will then illustrate the criterial approach to scope-discourse semantics, an approach which implies fully transparent syntactically generated interfaces with interpretive systems, and thus is sometimes said to ``syntacticize'' the expression of such interpretive properties. I will then compare this approach to possible alternatives which involve more opaque interfaces and assume more complex computations in postsyntactic interpretive systems.},

Der beste Beweis für die Unabhängigkeit von Syntax und Semantik sind nämlich nach Tesnière (1976: 40f.) semantisch absurde Sätze wie Rückwärtiges Schweigen verstimmt zulässigen Schleier (le silence vertébral indispose la voile licite), die strukturell korrekt sind und dieselbe Struktur aufweisen wie sinnvolle Sätze.},

Rules are required because the tokens of L are for all practical purposes infinite and thus cannot possibly be stored individually in a finite organism. The rule-based character of linguistic},

  abstract = {This paper describes the treatment of passive and compound past tense in FrGramm, a computational grammar of French, implemented within Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) using the XLE software. Due to the dual auxiliary system and past participle agreement, the latter periphrasis manifests greater structural complexity and therefore presents a greater challenge to computational implementation in French than in languages such as English and Portuguese. An additional difficulty is modeling the morphological and syntactic-semantic regularities of the passive construction. In FrGramm, this problem is solved by means of a productive lexical rule. FrGramm also implements the constraints governing the building of both verbal periphrases, excepting participle object agreement. The implementation was evaluated by applying a parser to a set of 157 grammatical sentences and a set of 279 ungrammatical sentences. All sentences from the former set were correctly parsed. Only two constructions from the latter set that violate the linear precedence of the compound past auxiliary over the passive auxiliary were analyzed as grammatical. FrGramm is the only LFG grammar of French with similar coverage that is freely available on-line. A future version will handle participle object agreement and avoid the mentioned overgeneration.},

In this paper, we discuss the claim by Perini (2010) that there is no passive voice in Portuguese. We compare this approach to the one of POLFIE. This is a computational grammar of Polish which was developed within the framework of LFG and implemented in XLE. In this grammar, the passive construction is an adjective predicative construction. We present additional morphological evidence on the adjectival status of the passive participle in Portuguese and implement this analysis in BrGram, a computational grammar of Brazilian Portuguese that is analogous to POLFIE.},
